    "mlops-agent: Once approved by Architect team with ARB & PRB, I help users to follow Guardrails and use MLOPs templates to register, deploy and promote the model."
    "tech team:  I have lots of tech agents working under me. 1.Model registration agent, 2.Model deployment agent, 3.Model promote agent, 4.Model Monitoring agent, 5.Model validation agent, 6.Model testing agent, 7.Posit aks agent, 8.Notification agent, 9.Evolution Agent,10.ddf Agent"
    "platform-agent: I help MLOPs agent to get access to Databricks workspace."
    "rationale: A modular, automated process for disease progression model (DPM) development enables R&D teams to rapidly simulate and evaluate future clinical trials for various inclusion criteria and study designs. Centralizing and tracking versions of the DPM simplifies integration of new data and future model adaptations, improves reproducibility and supports efficient in scilico trial simulations. Trial simulation can be performed at scale utilizing data bricks compute power"
